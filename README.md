**🧭 Project Overview**

A collaborative project and task management system built with Spring Boot.
It enables secure authentication, role-based access, project and task organization, comments, tags, and AI-powered task analysis using Google Gemini.
The system also integrates with RabbitMQ, Prometheus, and Grafana for asynchronous messaging and performance monitoring.

**⚙️ Architecture**

Modular, layered Spring Boot structure

RESTful API backend

Token-based authentication

Dockerized monitoring and messaging services

Main Layers:

Controller: Handles REST API requests

Service: Contains business logic

Repository: Handles database operations

Entity & DTO: Data modeling and transfer

**✨ Key Features**
**🔐 Authentication & Security**

User registration and login with encrypted passwords

JWT-based authentication (access and refresh tokens)

Role-based access control (Admin, Team Leader, Member)

Token refresh functionality

**🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User Management**

Create and manage user accounts

Check for existing usernames or emails

Enable/disable user accounts

Load user details for authentication

**🗂️ Project Management**

Create, update, and delete projects

Assign projects to owners

Search and list projects by name

Enforce ownership and admin permissions

**✅ Task Management**

Create and update tasks within projects

Assign users and tags to tasks

Track task status and due dates

Filter tasks by user, project, or status

Automatically detect overdue tasks

Send task reminders and notifications

**💬 Comments**

Add and view comments on tasks

Delete comments (only by author or admin)

View all comments for a specific task

**🏷️ Tags**

Create, update, and delete tags

Prevent duplicate tag creation

Assign multiple tags to tasks

**📬 Email Notifications**

Send email alerts for new task assignments

Simple text-based email delivery

Integration with RabbitMQ for async processing

**🤖 AI Task Advisor (Gemini Integration)**

Uses Google Vertex AI – Gemini 1.5 model

Analyzes project tasks and suggests execution order

Detects dependencies and bottlenecks

Generates concise recommendations for project managers

**🐇 RabbitMQ Integration**

Asynchronous messaging system for task events

Supports scalable notification and real-time updates

Optional integration with email and WebSocket systems

**📊 Monitoring & Metrics**

Integrated Prometheus for metrics collection

Grafana dashboards for visualization

Metrics exposed through Spring Boot Actuator (/actuator/prometheus)

**🧪 Testing & Quality**

Unit tests for core service and utility layers

Integration tests covering REST endpoints and database logic

Automated testing and build verification via GitHub Actions CI
